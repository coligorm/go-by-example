Using this git repo to practise programming Go:  
[beginner-friendly-programming-exercises](https://github.com/py-study-group/beginner-friendly-programming-exercises/blob/master/exercises.md)

It is made for Python solutions, but I will be using Go, hense, I will not fork and upload solutions.

I will be using the following two sites for understanding the language and syntax:
- https://gobyexample.com/
- https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/

I will update [parent README](../README.md) with any notes that I deem useful for my learnings.
